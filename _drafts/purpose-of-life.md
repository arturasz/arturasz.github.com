    I used to be like that with video games. This probably wasn’t a good
    thing. In fact, for many years it was kind of a problem. I would sit and
    play video games instead of doing more important things like studying
    for an exam, or showering regularly, or speaking to other humans
    face-to-face.

    It wasn’t until I gave up the games that I realized my passion wasn’t
    for the games themselves (although I do love them). My passion is for
    improvement, being good at something and then trying to get better. The
    games themselves — the graphics, the stories — they were cool, but I can
    easily live without them. It’s the competition — with others, but
    especially with myself — that I thrive on.
