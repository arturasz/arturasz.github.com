  I am a mouse hater. I prefer doing everything with keyboard. Browsing
  was always a chore for me until vimium came to rescue...

You know, all those scary stories about carpal tuner syndrome. Yep they got me.
And also using mouse is so slow. And you have to remove your hands from the keyboard. Which is annoying.

So while I was still a .NET developer I was coding with Visual Studio
and vim add-on. When I moved to pure front-end and got my first Mac I
move to terminal and vim (trying to get emacs at the moment). So
everything is great except... Browsers... Yep... They requires a lot of
mouse, even though <a href="https://www.apple.com/magictrackpad/">Mac Magic Trackpad</a> you still have to move your hands.
Anyway after some research I found out about <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/vimium/dbepggeogbaibhgnhhndojpepiihcmeb">Vimium</a>
And it is simply amazing...

Try it.

P.s. gaming with only keyboard or trackpad still sucks...
